# About this porject

This repository contains data in support of our work ["Exact Quench Dynamics from Algebraic Geometry"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10568). 
There are two parts of data, one is for Loschmidt echo and one is for Renyi entropy. 
In each folder, there is a Mathematica .wl file that plots the relavant data

## Loschmidt Echo

/LosEcho/data contains Loschmidt echo of XXX spin chain up to L=20 and the theoretical stable value
/LosEcho/LosEcho_main.wl plots the Loschmidt echo as a function of time t for L up to 20 and the corresponding theoretical stable value

## Diagonal Renyi Entropy

/Renyi_Entropy/data contains Renyi entropies of order 2,3,4 and L up to 20.

/Renyi_Entropy/renyi_main.wl plots the renyi entropies for each order and the correspinding linear fit as function of length L.
